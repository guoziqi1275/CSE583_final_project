Dave works in a conservation practitioner, he gathered leopard photos from cameras set up in the field, and he wants to identify leopards in a simple way without clicking folders and files one by one. He doesn't know any coding stuff or any graph theory. He just want to do the identification task in a straightforward way and get a number of how many individuals are there.
